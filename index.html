 <h1>Michael Ranoia Poem 8/29/24</h1>
    <h2>A Day Ago</h2>
    <p> My mind is stuck living in a yesterday</p>
    <p> Too busy on the good times we shared</p>
    <p>You're no good, that's what they all say</p>
    <p>It's upsetting me because I always cared</p>
    <p>I wish things were good between us</p>
    <p>I wish we could start over and forget</p>
    <p>When you look at me there is no trust</p>
    <p> When I look at us there's only regret</p>
    <p> The downfall was from an arrogant ego</p>
    <p>I really miss you from so lomg ago</p>
