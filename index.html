        <h1>Michael Ranoia Poem 9/3/24</h1>
        <h2>A Day Ago</h2>
        <p>My mind is stuck living in a <em>yesterday</em></p>
        <p>Too busy on the good times we <em>shared</em></p>
        <p>You're no good, that's what they all <em>say</em></p>
        <p>It's upsetting me because I always <em>cared</em></p>
        <br />
        <p>I wish things were good between <em>us</em></p>
        <p>I wish we could start over and <em>forget</em></p>
        <p>When you look at me there is no <em>trust</em></p>
        <p>When I look at us there's only <em>regret</em></p>
        <br />
        <strong>
            <p>The downfall was from an arrogant ego</p>
            <p>I really miss you from so lomg ago</p>
